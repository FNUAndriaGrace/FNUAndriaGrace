## 🧠 What I Do

- 🧠 Applied **Machine Learning** & **Deep Learning** for real-world problems: demand forecasting, resume parsing, emotion recognition
- 💬 Building intelligent systems with **LLMs**, **Agentic AI**, and **RAG pipelines**
- 🏥 Automating medical diagnostics using **keypoint detection models** (VHS from X-rays)
- 🎶 Generating music using **latent diffusion models**
- 🌆 Forecasting urban mobility with **LSTM & ML ensembles**

---

### 🔭 I’m currently working on:
- Deep learning for **automated VHS measurement** from canine X-rays  
- **Citi Bike demand forecasting** using time series models (LSTM, XGBoost, ARIMA)  
- **Generative music generation** using Latent Diffusion Models (AudioLDM2)  
- **Agentic AI** systems for resume-job matching and curriculum alignment  

---

### 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- LLMOps tools: **LangChain**, **RAG pipelines**, and prompt tuning  
- **FastAPI** for ML app deployment  
- Advanced interpretability with **PyTorch Lightning**, SHAP & Grad-CAM  

---

### 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
